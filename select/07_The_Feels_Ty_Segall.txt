Now that I look into your eyes
I realize you're the same as me
Just wanted to be free

And when we look into the skies
We realize it just can't be
You'll never be free

And all your friends, where are they now?
And your family don't lead ya now
Oh, it's only a dream
Yes, it's only a dream

Take yourself on down the street
Fear the place that you shall meet
They are your family now
They are your family now

And when I look into your eyes
I realize you're the same as me
Youll never be free
