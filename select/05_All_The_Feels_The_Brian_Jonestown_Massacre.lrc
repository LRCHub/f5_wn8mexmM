[00:22.13] Sometimes when I dream
[00:27.66] It takes me back home
[00:33.07] Then I realise as I open my eyes
[00:38.91] That my home is gone
[00:44.10] So I'll just stay where I'm at
[00:59.10] 
[00:55.23] The past it seems far away
[01:00.62] I think about it sometimes
[01:06.37] The conversations we had
[01:09.02] The times that you made me mad
[01:12.33] The times that you blew my mind, yeah
[01:17.55] It seems a lifetime away
[01:29.55] 
[01:24.73] I remember in the evening
[01:28.19] You were leaving, gave no warning
[01:30.10] I just closed my eyes and cried
[01:40.50] It felt like dying
[01:49.50] 
[02:20.66] I remember you were leaving
[02:23.46] With no warning, couldn't face me
[02:26.03] You were gone and I just cried
[02:32.14] But in the morning when I woke up
[02:34.94] I was happy, felt alive
[02:37.32] I felt alive
[02:43.32] 
[02:42.57] There is one thing I can tell you
[02:45.58] That I know in my heart
[02:48.00] You will survive
